### About Me

**I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student with an unusual passion for programming and project development. I also have a very high learning speed. One of my drawbacks is being meticulous about my code (it has to be in the most optimized state). And before I forget, I prefer coding at night rather than during the day.**

- Winform
